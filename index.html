                <h3>Current Project: Agentic AI Multilingual Math Practice Tracker</h3>
                <p>This project integrates my research and technical skills to address critical needs for multilingual learners in mathematics [8-11].</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Conducted foundational research to identify critical pain points for multilingual students in STEM, revealing a need for language support in math problem-solving.</li>
                    <li>Translated qualitative insights into design concepts, focusing on accessibility and comprehension for newcomer learners [8-11].</li>
                    <li>Designed and built an interactive prototype using Python, Django, and the Gemini API to validate research findings and test a core feature: enabling users to record math problems with translated explanations [8, 9].</li>
