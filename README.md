## About Me

I am a **Ph.D. Candidate in Language and Literacy Education at the University of Toronto**, specializing in multilingual STEM education and curriculum studies. My academic work focuses on developing culturally responsive resources to support immigrant and international students in math and STEM subjects.

As an experienced **Full-Stack Developer**, I bridge the gap between educational theory and practice by building accessible, data-driven, and scalable web applications. I have a proven track record of designing and deploying solutions using React/JavaScript, Python/Django, and Express/Node.js, often integrating cutting-edge AI and Generative AI features.

My passion lies in leveraging technology to create innovative and impactful educational tools for diverse learners.
